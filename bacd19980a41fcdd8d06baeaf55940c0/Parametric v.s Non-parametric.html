{"data": "## Parametric model v.s. Non-parametric model\n\n### Abstract  \n\nSimply discussed the concepts of \\\"parametric\\\" and \\\"non-parametric\\\"\n\n<sep>\n\n### Takeaways\n\n**There is no precise and universally acceptable definition of the term \\\"non-parametric\\\"**. In deep learning, these concepts are frequently mentioned and discussed within the probabilistic generative modeling field and the more preferable terms are \\\"**prescribed**\\\" and \\\"**implicit**\\\". **Prescribed** models provides an explicit specification of the distribution, whereas **implicit** models make milder assumption about the distribution and have less limit on the architecture. As an example, GANs are implicit models while Normalizing flows, VAEs and current DDPMs (Diffusion denosing probabilistic model) can be seen as prescribed models. Since implicit models do not have a likelihood function, we can then utilize tools including *method-of-moments* and *mean-shift estimation* to approximate the parameters.\n\nShakir[4] discussed the learning of implicit generative model and point out that we could guide the learning of models by comparing model distribution and data distribution, which is called density estimation-by-comparison. Therefore, the learning of implicit generative model comprises two stages: *comparision* and *estimation*, where comparison refers to comparing model distribution and data distribution via *density ratio*: $p(x) \\over q_{\\theta}(x)$, or *density differences*  $p(x) - q_{\\theta}(x)$, where $p(x)$ is true data distribution and $q_{\\theta}$ is model distribution learned by model with parameter $\\theta$. Generally, There are four approaches for density estimation:  \n\n- class-probability estimation  \n- divergence minimisation  \n- ratio matching  \n- moment matching  \n\n(I have to go...
