{"data": "## Understanding Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)\n\n### Abstract\nThis blog covered the following topics: (working in progress)  \n- Introduced technical details of DDPM including step-by-step mathematical derivations.  \n- Introduced DDIM, Denoising diffusion implicit model, which is proposed for sampling acceleration.  \n- Draw connections between DDPM and current generative models.  \n\nA highly recommended blog is [1], where most details on DDPM, DDIM, LDM, guidance, and current large-scale DMs, etc, are presented. In this blog, I mainly focus on details that are not mentioned in [1] but are somewhat confusing. Therefore, it's assumed that audiences understand how do DDPMs work and know the basic formulas in DDPM[2].\n\nIt is well known that DDPM[2] is proposed based on the theories presented in [3]. It proposed to optimize the objective that directly compares predicted noise and ground truth:\n\\begin{center}\n\\[ L_1=\\left\\lVert \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t,t)-\\epsilon \\right\\rVert \\]\n\\end{center}\n\nQuestion 1:  What makes the current form of diffusion model? What is the improvement proposed in DDPM[2] that makes diffusion models work based on [3]?\n\n\n\n### References\nBlog  \n[1] https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/\n\nPaper  \n[2]  \n[3] ", "msg": "success"}
